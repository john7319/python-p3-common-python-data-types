# You can also create a new string by using the built-in str() constructor function (though it's not common you'd need to):

str("I'm a string")


dog_name = "Lucy"
print(f"Say hello to my dog {dog_name}")

price_1 = 3
price_2 = 2.5

print(f"Item 1 costs ${price_1:.2f}")
# => Item 1 costs $3.00
print(f"Item 2 costs ${price_2:.2f}")
# => Item 2 costs $2.50
